Games which are owned only by one or two players, which are popular
Game.joins(:ownerships).select('id, name, count(*) as c').group(:game_id).having('c <2')
->
SELECT id, name, count(*) as c FROM "games" INNER JOIN "ownerships" ON "ownerships"."game_id" = "games"."id" GROUP BY "game_id" HAVING c <2

When comparing user with one (or more) other player(s), also show commonalities in your highly-rated (r >= 8)  games.

Add matches from up-and-coming LoBs

Consider importing all games from bgg in one pass (perhaps from a csv dump of all games). ( ~80k games? )

Permit import / refresh of a single event, and single user.

When showing a user's owned games which are most desired for play by others, prefer games that no one else owns.

Show a user's most desired game

It is possible to have two copies of a game in your bgg collection.  
For now, I'll just ignore the second item (so if you only own the second one, the system will not record that you own the game at all).  This is simpler than merging.

Add indices and uniqueness constraints on the join tables.

In joining games with, and counting, play_wishes and ownerships, be sure not to 
accidentally exclude games with ZERO rows in owner or play_wishes.
