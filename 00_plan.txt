OVERVIEW: 
1: get the meetup ids, BGG ids, and free-text "favourite games" of the members of LoB meetup group.  Cache this.
1.1. 
1.2. From each member's bio ("intro") for LoB meetup group, find their bgg username e.g. "bgg_username:enz0".
1.3. Find and store the names of their favourite games as written up in their LoB question answer "What is your favourite game".
1.4 try to find their bgg accounts from their LoB question answers on the meetup

2: From BGG find each member's "want to play"s, their favourite games, and their owned games.

3: find out who's going to the next week or two of LoB meetups.  (optional boolean: "only check events I've RSVP'd "yes" to)

4: cross check that information to find who wants to play (or who owns a game you want to play.

QUERY:

I'm going to LoB tomorrow...
  What are the favourite games of the other ppl going?
  What are the want-to-play games of the other ppl going?

When can I next play game X at LoB?

NOTE: will likely get a 202 and the bgg api will crash.  need to retry later (1 second, normally) to get the actual response.

NOTE: a bgg handle can have a space in it.  (argh!)
or an _ (underscore)
it is correct to put the space in the name when calling the ruby BGG library.
