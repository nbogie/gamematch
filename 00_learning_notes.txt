Apple-E: goto-anything, in cloud9 IDE.

AR: ModelA.joins(:tableB) will do an inner join between A and B (and so will omit anything from A that doesn't have a row in B).
For outer joins in active record, either specify the join with sql, 
or use includes() with where(): e.g. Article.includes(:comments).where(comments: { visible: true })
but note that joins() is prefered over includes()
