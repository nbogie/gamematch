* AR: ModelA.joins(:tableB) will do an inner join between A and B (and so will omit anything from A that doesn't have a row in B).
For outer joins in active record, either specify the join with sql, 
or use includes() with where(): e.g. Article.includes(:comments).where(comments: { visible: true })
but note that joins() is prefered over includes()
Example of left join: Game.includes(:ownerships).where(ownerships: { game_id: 1..500 })

* SQL example: Games, along with an ownership count and a play-wish count.  (with one owner).

SELECT          games.*, 
                Count(DISTINCT play_wishes.player_id) AS pw_count, 
                Count(DISTINCT ownerships.player_id)  AS own_count 
FROM            "games" 
LEFT OUTER JOIN play_wishes 
ON              play_wishes.game_id = games.id 
LEFT OUTER JOIN ownerships 
ON              ownerships.game_id = games.id 
GROUP BY        games.id 
HAVING          own_count = 1 
ORDER BY        pw_count desc limit 50

* Counting and NULLs: The function count(expression) only counts entries where expression is not null.
